# This algorithm compares transcript profiles from GEO data set  
# peripheral B lymphocytes between patients with systemic lupus 
# erythematosus (SLE) and normal healthy controls in an XY scatterplot.  
#
## README:
## 1) set working directory, if necessary    #setwd("/Users/crystalmusser/Documents/Rhome")
## 2) run R program on .txt file
## 3) XY scatterplots will be generated in a new window
##
# The GEO summary of the data set is as follows:
# Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease with an 
# important clinical and biological heterogeneity. B lymphocytes appear 
# central to the development of SLE which is characterized by the production 
# of a large variety of autoantibodies and hypergammaglobulinemia. In mice, 
# immature B cells from spontaneous lupus prone animals are able to produce 
# autoantibodies when transferred into immunodeficient mice, strongly 
# suggesting the existence of intrinsic B cell defects during lupus. In order 
# to approach these defects in humans, we compared the peripheral B cell 
# transcriptomes of quiescent lupus patients to normal B cell transcriptomes.
#
# RESULTS:
# The first XY scatterplot shows all data pertinent to the 2nd SLE patient sample 
# (found as “sle.2” in column 2, since R starts indexing at 1 instead of 0) 
# versus the 1st normal control (“control.1” at column 18). Plotted as 
# Normal vs. SLE, there is a clear positive directional correlation.
#
# The second XY scatter plot simarly plots Normal B-cells vs. SLE B-cells, 
# but restricts the amount of data shown to the first 20 probesets. To 
# accomplish this, I created new variables to hold subset control and 
# sample vectors, which were then used in a simple “p” type plot() function.

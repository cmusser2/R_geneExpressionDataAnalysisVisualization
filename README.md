# R_geneExpressionDataAnalysisVisualization
My code adapted from assignments submitted to the graduate course taken at Johns Hopkins University while pursuing a M.S. in Bioinformatics. 

- XY Scatterplots:
   - comparing single diseased patient sample to healthy control sample
   - comparing many probesets
   - changing the shape and color of points on the scatterplot
- Gene profile plots:
   - casting a vector to numberic
   - visualizing a gene profile
- Box plot:
   - visualizing a gene profile across conditions with a singler distribution box per condition.
   - creating a factor vector indicating disease:normal condition

Learning Goals:
- Learn basic data manipulation & plotting in R

Materials/Methods:
- Data set: "sle_b_cell.txt"
  - Compares the transcript profiles from peripheral B lymphocytes between patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) compared to healthy, normal control patients.

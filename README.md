# R_geneExpressionDataAnalysisVisualization
My code published here as proof of concept to graduate learning goals, adapted from assignments I'd submitted to the graduate course AS.410.671 "Gene Expression Data Analysis and Visualization" taken at Johns Hopkins University while pursuing my M.S. in Bioinformatics (graduated May 2023). 

Learning Goals:
- Learn basic data manipulation & plotting in R
- Outlier identification (Gene Correlation Plot, Hierarchical Clustering Dendrogram, CV vs. Means Plot, Average Correlation Plot)
- XY Scatterplots:
   - comparing single diseased patient sample to healthy control sample
   - comparing many probesets
   - changing the shape and color of points on the scatterplot
- Gene profile plots:
   - casting a vector to numberic
   - visualizing a gene profile
- Box plot:
   - visualizing a gene profile across conditions with a singler distribution box per condition.
   - creating a factor vector indicating disease:normal condition

Materials/Methods:
- Data set: "sle_b_cell.txt"
  - Compares the transcript profiles from peripheral B lymphocytes between patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) compared to healthy, normal control patients.
